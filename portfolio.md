# Backend Engineer 

## Profile Summary
A backend-leaning engineer skilled in Python, FastAPI, automation, and AI-assisted problem solving. I possess a strong system-thinking foundation with networking and reliability awareness. I excel in fast learning, rapid prototyping, and building clean, modular, production-minded backend services.

## Core Technical Skills
* Languages & Frameworks: Python Backend Development, FastAPI, REST API Design.


* Infrastructure: Docker & Containerization , Networking and Systems Thinking.


* Data & Automation: Data Pipelines & Background Workers , AI-assisted Engineering & Automation.


## Featured Project: FastAPI Prediction Endpoint
**Overview**
A minimal but production-ready backend built with FastAPI using a clean modular architecture1010. This project demonstrates the ability to structure code for scalability and maintainability.

**Key Features**
- Endpoint: /api/v1/predict endpoint equipped with rigorous validation.


- Business Logic: Service-layer logic implementing mean-based normalization calculations for risk scoring.


- Deployment: Fully Dockerized for consistent deployment across environments.


## Architecture Overview
**The project follows a separation of concerns pattern detailed in ARCHITECTURE.md:**

- API Layer: Handles FastAPI async routing.


- Schemas Layer: Manages typed input/output validation.


- Services Layer: Contains the business logic abstraction.


- Models Layer: Designed to be extendable for Machine Learning (ML) or ORM integration.


## Production Roadmap
**Designed with an expandable architecture to support future integrations including PostgreSQL, S3, Redis, Celery, CI/CD pipelines, and monitoring tools19191919.**


**Unique Value Propositions**
- AI-First Problem Solver: Leveraging modern tools for efficient engineering.


- Systems Thinker: Applying networking insight to backend architecture.


- Fast Adopter: combining rapid learning with tactical execution.
